# Per Capita Co2 Emission, 1750 - 2020 


See project here: https://sarahgrevy.github.io/co2_emission

## Main Findings:
- Global COâ‚‚ emissions fell by 6.4% or 2.3 billion tonnes in 2020
- The U.S. saw a change of -10% which means it produces 10% less emissions in 2020 than in 2019
- The pandemic hit different sectors of society. Aviation and Surface transportation (travel by rail and road) saw the biggest drops at nearly 15% and 17% during the first wave of the pandemic but has slowly started to recover.
- While the Covid-19 pandemic might have offered a short-term reduction in global emissions, the pace at which countries are rebounding will likely outdo it.
